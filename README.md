# Project Workflow: Employee Analytics Pipeline

This project is structured as a machine learning pipeline to analyze employee data and predict outcomes like attrition or performance. The workflow steps mirror the creation and processing of the listed project files.

## Workflow Diagram
Below is a workflow representation of the key steps involved in this project:

1. **Kickoff**: File structure setup and initializing required directories/files.
2. **Writing**: Code development for data ingestion, validation, transformation, and model-related tasks.
3. **Design**: Styling and finalizing utility functions and components.
4. **Development**: Implementing pipelines (training and prediction) and preparing the app for deployment.
5. **Testing**: Ensuring all components work together seamlessly before deploying.
6. **Post-Mortem**: Evaluating the workflow for improvements.

## Workflow Steps Explained

1. **Kickoff Meeting**
    - Goal: Prepare the project scaffolding and ensure the directory structure is created.
    - Script snippet:
      ```python
      for filepath in list_of_files:
          filepath = Path(filepath)
          filedir, filename = os.path.split(filepath)
          if filedir != "":
              os.makedirs(filedir, exist_ok=True)
          if not os.path.exists(filepath) or os.path.getsize(filepath) == 0:
              with open(filepath, "w") as f:
                  pass
      ```

2. **Writing**
    - Develop scripts for logging, exception handling, and utility functions.

3. **Design**
    - Build reusable components for data ingestion, validation, transformation, and model training.

4. **App Development**
    - Implement pipelines (training and prediction) and integrate with APIs (e.g., `app.py`).

5. **Testing on Live**
    - Perform integration testing to ensure all modules work seamlessly.

6. **Post-Mortem**
    - Review and improve the workflow, identifying areas for optimization.
